# Changelog

## Current Implementation Status (as of April 2024)

### Core Systems
- **Grid System**: Implemented with enhanced terrain generation, coherent water bodies, forest biomes, and improved world generation algorithms
- **Entity Framework**: Base Entity class with combat and resource gathering capabilities, including concrete Hero implementation
- **Turn-Based System**: Day/night cycle with player and enemy turns
- **Combat System**: XCOM-style probability combat with line of sight, range, and damage calculations with improved hit chances
- **Resource Management**: Resource collection and usage, with harvesting mechanics and forest clusters
- **Fog of War**: Vision system based on entity sight range, with improved visibility states
- **Development Environment**: Project setup with TypeScript, webpack, and npm scripts for easy development
- **Enemy System**: Implemented multiple enemy types with unique stats, behaviors, and improved AI strategies

### UI Components
- **GridRenderer**: Comprehensive implementation for rendering the game grid, entities, and visibility states
- **UIManager**: Framework for managing game UI elements and interactions
- **CombatUI**: Fully functional combat interface with attack buttons and hit/miss feedback

### Recent Improvements
- **Enhanced Terrain Generation**: Implemented a multi-stage terrain generation algorithm that creates:
  - Natural-looking water bodies (lakes and rivers) covering 20-40% of the map
  - Forest biomes with clustered trees as harvestable wood resources
  - Better distribution of resources across the map
- Fixed module resolution issues with proper index files for cleaner imports
- Improved code organization with better file structure
- Added concrete Hero entity implementation
- Enhanced fog of war and visibility system
- Fixed entity creation and instantiation issues
- Added detailed setup instructions for developers
- **Enhanced Enemy Mobs**: Implemented four unique enemy types with distinctive behaviors:
  - Zombie: Melee-focused enemy that relentlessly chases the player
  - Skeleton: Ranged attacker that maintains distance and retreats when threatened
  - Spider: Fast-moving enemy that attempts to flank the player
  - Creeper: Explosive enemy with powerful area-of-effect attacks
- **Advanced Enemy AI**: Implemented a sophisticated AI system that:
  - Uses unique movement and attack strategies for each enemy type
  - Employs tactical flanking and positioning
  - Dynamically adjusts aggression based on health and distance
  - Manages action points efficiently for movement and attacks
- **Robust Combat System**:
  - Balance improvements for more engaging combat
  - Fixed hit chance calculations for more reliable attacks
  - Enhanced damage calculation with proper armor effectiveness
  - Visual feedback for successful attacks and kills
  - Rebalanced entity stats for better gameplay experience
- **UI Improvements**:
  - Enhanced combat panel with clearly visible attack buttons
  - Keyboard shortcuts for common actions (End Turn)
  - Wider tooltips for better readability
  - Visual highlighting for selected entities
  - Better visibility of critical game information

## What's Missing

### Specific Entity Implementations:
- No Worker classes yet
- No Building implementations

### Enemy AI Improvements:
- No group coordination or tactical decision making
- Special attacks are defined but not fully implemented

### Resource Gathering Mechanics:
- Basic framework exists but needs integration with entity actions

### Building System:
- No building placement or construction mechanics
- No building effects (resource generation, defense bonuses)

### Technology/Crafting System:
- No crafting or technology progression

### Game UI:
- No building or technology UI

### Win/Loss Conditions:
- No game objectives or end conditions defined

## Next Steps for Implementation

Based on the game concept and current implementation, here's what should be prioritized next:

### 1. Complete Hero Functionality
- Add ability for Hero to gather resources
- Implement better movement and action visualization
- Add hero stats and progression

### 2. Complete Other Entity Implementations
- Create specific entity classes for Worker, Buildings
- Define unique attributes and abilities for each entity type
- Implement building placement and construction

### 3. Enhance Enemy AI
- Implement group coordination between enemies
- Create more challenging behaviors for night phases
- Further balance enemy difficulty based on the day/night cycle progression

### 4. Expand Resource System
- Complete resource gathering mechanics
- Add resource depletion and regeneration

### 5. Build the Complete Game UI
- Add building and crafting menus
- Implement tech tree visualization
- Add in-game tutorial elements

### 6. Implement Technology Progression
- Design a crafting and technology tree
- Create upgrade paths for buildings and units
- Implement research/crafting UI

### 7. Add Win/Loss Conditions
- Implement game objectives
- Create victory and defeat scenarios
- Design level progression or endless survival mode

## Architecture Recommendations

The foundation of GridCraft Defense is well-designed with a solid architecture following good software principles:
- Clear separation of concerns with systems for combat, resources, entities, etc.
- Modular design with abstract base classes for extension
- Thoughtful implementation of core game mechanics like combat and resource management

To maintain scalability and clean architecture, we recommend:
- **Implement Entity Factory**: Create a factory pattern for entity creation to centralize entity instantiation logic
- **Design a Component System**: Consider refactoring entities to use a component-based system for more flexibility and composition of behaviors
- **Create a Proper AI System**: Develop a modular AI system with different behavior components that can be mixed and matched for various enemy types
- **Implement Event System**: Add an event system for game events to decouple systems and make the code more maintainable
- **Focus on Building Implementation Next**: This is a critical missing piece that will enable resource generation, defense strategies, and progression mechanics
